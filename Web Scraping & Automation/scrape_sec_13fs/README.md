# Treasury Tales: An Adventure in SEC Data Exploration
Welcome to the magical world of "Treasury Tales"! This enchanting repository houses our Python Web Scraper, a delightful tool for unraveling the mysteries of 13F filings (those intriguing declarations of mutual fund holdings) from the SEC's enchanted forest, known as [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html). Our scraper not only seeks out these filings but also artfully crafts a .tsv file from the gleaned data, like an alchemist turning lead into gold.

## Spellbook Requirements

#### Embarking on Your Journey
- Cast the spell `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or, if you're a wizard of the `pipenv` school, use `pipenv install`) to gather all the magical ingredients.
- Summon the scraper by invoking `python scraper.py` (or, in the lands of `pipenv`, chant `pipenv run python scraper.py`).
- When the oracle speaks, respond with the 10-digit CIK number of the mutual fund you seek to unravel.
