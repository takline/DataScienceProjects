**Projects Overview**

I've organized this repo to showcase my work along the following domains:

1. **AI:** This section features projects using platforms like OpenAI, Claude, and Vertex AI. You'll find examples of machine learning model implementation, natural language processing tasks, and AI deployments. The focus is on practical use-cases such as predictive modeling, text analysis, and integrating AI within existing systems.

2. **Web Scraping & Automation:** The projects here showcase practical web scraping techniques using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium. These include scripts for automated data extraction from websites, dealing with dynamic web pages, and handling data in various formats. The emphasis is on creating reliable and efficient scripts that can gather and process data from the web.

3. **Data Engineering & Pipelines:** My bread and butter - data engineering. Here you will see my experience with building data pipelines (ETL, data warehousing, streaming, etc...). Tools and technologies like Apache Kafka, Spark, and SQL databases are commonly used here. The projects demonstrate effective data management from ingestion to processing and storage.

4. **Cloud Computing:** Work involving AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and other tech (ex: Snowflake).

5. **Analytics, Reporting & Visualization:** Some of my more fun work creating data visualizations for clients.  Using tools like Tableau, Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn), I've focused on effectively translating data into understandable formats, making it easy for decision-makers to grasp key insights.

6. **Blender & 3D Python Modeling:** Showcases some of my pet projects on 3D modelling with Blender's python module.
