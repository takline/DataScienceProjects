##  URL Information Extractor and Summarizer to Notion - Overview
This module is designed to extract information from URLs, retrieve page text, and scrape data based on the company associated with the URL. It extends link processing to include summarizing content using a complex language model (LangChainLLM) and saving summaries to a Notion database. This tool is ideal for content aggregation, analysis, and documentation purposes.

## Features
- Extracts key information from URLs, including company name and page ID.
- Summarizes web page content using the LangChainLLM language model.
- Creates a new page in Notion with the summary, key points, and tags.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or later
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `langchainllm` (hypothetical), and any other dependencies for the custom scrapers (`Instagram`, `Threads`, `Twitter`, `YouTube`).

Additionally, you'll need:
- API keys and access tokens for Notion and any other services used by the scrapers.
- A Notion database set up to receive the summaries.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```
   Install other dependencies as required by your environment or the specific scrapers you intend to use.

3. Configure the `config.py` file with your API keys, tokens, and database IDs.

## Usage
To use this module, you'll typically call the `process_link` method with a URL. Here's a simple example:

```python
from enhanced_link_processor import EnhancedLinkProcessor

processor = EnhancedLinkProcessor()
notion_page_url = processor.process_link("https://example.com/some-page")
print(f"Notion page created: {notion_page_url}")
```

## Configuration
The module requires several configurations to interact with external services:
- **Notion Integration**: Set up an integration on Notion's Developer Portal and share your database with this integration. Provide the integration token and database ID in `config.py`.
- **Language Model Setup**: If using a custom or third-party language model, ensure it's correctly configured and authenticated as needed.

## Custom Scrapers
This module supports extending or customizing scrapers for different websites. Each scraper should implement a method `get_data(page_id)` that returns structured data from the page.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. Please follow standard pull request and code review practices. Ensure any new dependencies or services are well documented.

   ```bash
   pip install ffmpeg-python google-cloud-storage google-cloud-aiplatform requests
   ```

3. Set up your GCP credentials by placing your service account JSON key file in a known directory and setting an environment variable to its path:

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
   ```

4. Set the necessary environment variables for your Google Cloud setup:

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="your-google-cloud-project-id"
   export GOOGLE_LOCATION="your-google-cloud-project-location"
   export GOOGLE_BLOB="your-google-cloud-storage-bucket-name"
   ```

## Configuration

Modify the script to include your specific GCP project details, bucket names, and any other preferences. You may need to adjust parameters such as bitrate thresholds or output formats according to your requirements.

## Usage

The script `video_summarize.py` consists of several functions that together facilitate the process of video compression, uploading, and summarization. Here's how to use it:

1. **Compress Video**: Automatically compresses videos that exceed a specific size threshold.

2. **Upload to GCS**: Uploads the compressed video to a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket.

3. **Generate Video Summary**: Utilizes Vertex AI's Generative Model to generate a summary of the video content.

4. **Handler Function**: Orchestrates the process from receiving a video file, compressing it, uploading it to GCS, generating a summary, and potentially integrating with additional services (e.g., saving summaries to a database or a platform like Notion).

To run the script:

```bash
python video_summarize.py
```

Ensure that you have an appropriate mechanism to trigger the script, such as a webhook or a scheduled task, depending on your application's architecture.

## Troubleshooting

- **ffmpeg not found**: Ensure ffmpeg is installed and accessible in your system's PATH, or refer to the installation guide provided in the script comments.
- **Google Cloud Authentication Issues**: Verify your service account permissions, ensure the JSON key file's path is correctly set, and check if the environment variables are correctly configured.
- **Vertex AI API Errors**: Confirm that the Vertex AI API is enabled for your project and that your service account has the necessary roles assigned.

## NotionGPT Notification System - Overview

This project provides a system for sending notifications for tasks managed in Notion. It leverages AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage of sensitive information, and the Pushover service for sending the notifications. The system identifies tasks due today, upcoming tasks, and late tasks, and notifies the user accordingly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `boto3` library for AWS services
- An AWS account with access to Secrets Manager
- A Pushover account for sending notifications
- Notion integration to manage tasks

### Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install `boto3` using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install boto3
   ```
3. Set up your AWS credentials to enable access to Secrets Manager. This typically involves configuring your `~/.aws/credentials` file or setting environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).

### Configuration

1. Store your Pushover `app_token` and `user_key`, along with any other necessary secrets, in AWS Secrets Manager. The default secret name is `notionGPT`, but this can be configured via environment variables.
2. Set the following environment variables as needed:
   - `NOTION_GPT_SECRET_NAME`: The name of the secret in AWS Secrets Manager (default: `notionGPT`).
   - `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region where your secrets are stored (default: `us-east-1`).

### Usage

To use this system, execute the main script and ensure that your Notion tasks are structured in a way that they can be processed by the script. You'll need to adapt the `handler` function to your specific Notion setup, particularly how tasks are categorized as today, upcoming, or late.

### Code Structure

- **SecretsManager**: Handles retrieval of secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
- **NotificationSender**: Sends notifications via Pushover based on task details.
- **process_tasks**: Processes lists of tasks and sends notifications for each task, with a delay between notifications to avoid rate limits.
- **handler**: The main entry point of the script. It retrieves secrets, processes tasks according to their due status, and manages timing for notifications.

## Development

- Extend or modify the task processing logic in `handler` to fit your Notion task management workflow.
- Adjust notification details and payload in `NotificationSender` as needed for your use case.
- Ensure to handle errors and exceptions, especially for network requests and AWS service access.
